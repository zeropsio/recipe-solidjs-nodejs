# Zerops x Solid - Node.js

Solid is a declarative Javascript library for creating fast, dynamic web apps. [Zerops](https://zerops.io) makes deploying and running Solid.js apps, both server side rendered and static, a breeze. This recipe showcases the SSR version, see [zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-static](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-static) for the static version.

## Deploy on Zerops

You can either click the deploy button to deploy directly on Zerops, or manually copy the [import yaml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-nodejs/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yml) to the import dialog in the Zerops app.

## Recipe features
- Latest Solid version generated with [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/) running on a load balanced **Zerops Node.js** service
- Server Side Rendering (SSR) with Vinxi.

## Production vs. development
This recipe is ready for production as is, and will scale horizontally by adding more containers in case of high traffic surges. If you want to achieve the highest baseline reliability and resiliace, start with at least two containers (add `minContainers: 2` in recipe YAML in the `app` service section, or change the minimum containers in "Automatic Scaling configuration" section of service detail).

Additionally for you might want to consider setting up [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for advanced and structured logging.

## Changes made over the default installation
If you want to modify your existing Solid app to efficiently run on Zerops, there are no changes needed in the codebase on top of the standard installation, just add [zerops.yml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-nodejs/blob/main/zerops.yml) to your repository.
